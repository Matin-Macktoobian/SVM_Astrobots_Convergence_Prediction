# Convergence prediction for the coordination of astrobot swarms (unconstrained version)
In this version, the parity of astrobots [1] are variable. [Parity is the direction of the rotation associated with the second arm of an astrobot.] The predictor is an SVM-based model which classifies convergence result of each astrobot which can be either `successful` or `unsuccessful` [2].
